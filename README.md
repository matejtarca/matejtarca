### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 Few of my note-worthy projects here on Github:
  - 🚙 Website developed for my local driving school using Next.js. Self-hosted on VPS using Nginx and PM2. [Repo link](https://github.com/matejtarca/AutoSkolaSmartNext).
  - 🧠 My bachelor thesis (in progress 🚧) - web application portal for hackathons built using Next.js 13 utilizing all new fresh stuff like app router, React server components and server actions. [Repo link](https://github.com/hackkosice/HackPortal).
  - 👀 This is where it all started - my first web project created on a hackathon in 2019 - custom cryptocurrency using Decent APIs awarded to volunteers in Kosice region. [Repo link](https://github.com/matejtarca/HackKosiceToken) - the repo is just a start of bigger startup and application - Helfni (unfortunately private)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (or want to learn)
  - 🛠️ Docker, DevOps and infra stuff
  - 🛌 How to chill out from programming 😅
- 💬 Ask me about
  - How to speed up Jest tests, how to utilize react server components in Next.js or just how am I doing (I prefer the third question)
- 📫 How to reach me
  - Does Github have IMs? (should it have? 😅) or just use my mail paired with Github.
- ⚡ Fun fact
  - 🪄 I did street magic in Berlin, London and Prague
